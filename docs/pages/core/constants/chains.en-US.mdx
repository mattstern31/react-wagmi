# Chains & Networks

Chain and network information for use with hooks, connectors, and anywhere else you need in your app.

## chain

Object containing chains by name. Useful for creating lists of specific chains, like `defaultL2Chains`.

```ts
import { chain } from '@wagmi/core'

const defaultL2Chains = [chain.optimism, chain.arbitrumOne]
```

You can also import individual chains from the tree shakeable `@wagmi/core/chains` entrypoint:

```ts
import { mainnet, optimism } from '@wagmi/core/chains'
```

## Default Groups

wagmi has built-in chain groups for convenience:

```ts
import {
  allChains,
  defaultChains, // mainnet, goerli
  defaultL2Chains, // arbitrum, optimism
} from '@wagmi/core'
```
