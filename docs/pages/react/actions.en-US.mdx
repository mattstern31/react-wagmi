# Actions

Sometimes the declarative nature of React Hooks doesn't work for parts of your app. All the `@wagmi/core` VanillaJS actions are importable using the `wagmi/actions` entrypoint:

```ts
import { fetchBlockNumber } from 'wagmi/actions'

await fetchBlockNumber()
```

See the [`@wagmi/core` docs](/core) for more info on what actions are available.
