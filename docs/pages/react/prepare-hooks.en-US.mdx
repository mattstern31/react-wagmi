# Prepare Hooks

In previous versions of wagmi, "transactional" hooks such as `useSendTransaction` and `useContractWrite` performed potentially long-running asynchronous work. On a slow network, these asynchronous tasks can take a while.

Performing asynchronous tasks in an event handler (like a button) or in an event that wasn't initiated by the user (like a page load) is not ideal as it can lead to a variety of connected user-experience (UX) related pitfalls ([listed below](#ux-pitfalls-without-prepare-hooks)).

Prepare Hooks allow you to eagerly perform this asynchronous work beforehand & generate the parameters required for their paired hook (e.g. `usePrepareSendTransaction` prepares a request for `useSendTransaction`).

wagmi currently has the following Prepare Hooks:

- [`usePrepareContractWrite`](/react/prepare-hooks/usePrepareContractWrite)
- [`usePrepareSendTransaction`](/react/prepare-hooks/usePrepareSendTransaction)

## UX Pitfalls without Prepare Hooks

You may have noticed one of the following pitfalls when using "transactional" hooks without performing the asynchronous work beforehand.

### Slow TTOW (Time To Open Wallet)

Performing long-running async work in between a user interaction (i.e. click handler) and opening the wallet can lead to a slow TTOW (Time To Open Wallet).

Under slow network conditions, it may confuse the end-user as to why the wallet is taking a while to open.

The video below shows the difference between a slow TTOW and a fast TTOW.

### No upfront validation

When using "transactional" hooks such as `useContractWrite` & `useSendTransaction`, the user will only get feedback on the status of the transaction once they have invoked the click handler.

There are some cases where we can perform upfront validation on a contract or transaction request before the user interacts with the click handler (such as checking if we can still mint on a contract).

See the comparison below for when a user tries to mint a sold out NFT.

By using a Prepare Hook, we can perform this eager validation before the click handler is invoked.

```tsx {5,25}
import * as React from 'react'
import { usePrepareContractWrite, useContractWrite } from 'wagmi'

export function MintNFT() {
  const { config, error, isError } = usePrepareContractWrite({
    address: '0xFBA3912Ca04dd458c843e2EE08967fC04f3579c2',
    abi: [
      {
        name: 'mint',
        type: 'function',
        stateMutability: 'nonpayable',
        inputs: [],
        outputs: [],
      },
    ],
    functionName: 'mint',
  })
  const { data, write } = useContractWrite(config)

  return (
    <div>
      <button disabled={!write} onClick={() => write()}>
        Mint
      </button>
      {isError && <div>Error: {error.message}</div>}
    </div>
  )
}
```
